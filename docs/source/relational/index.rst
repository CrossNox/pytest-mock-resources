Relational Database Fixtures
============================

All of the officially supported relational databases (SQLite, Postgres, Redshift,
and MYSQL) support a minimum level of parity of features. Generally they will
all have intercompatibile function signatures, except wherein there are particular
features supported by a database which is unsupported in one of the others.

For database-specific support, see the corresponding :ref:`redshift-label`, :ref:`Postgres`, or :ref:`SQLite` pages.
